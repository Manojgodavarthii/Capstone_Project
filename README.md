**Elevate Your Academic Journey: A Personalized Elective Recommendation System**


This repository presents a novel solution to a common challenge faced by students at Presidency University: selecting optimal electives. Our system leverages advanced algorithms and data analysis techniques to provide personalized elective recommendations, aligning with students' academic interests and preferences.

Key Features

Personalized Recommendations: Tailored suggestions based on students' past academic performance, interests, and course prerequisites.
Intelligent Course Matching: Efficiently matches students with suitable electives, considering course capacity constraints and scheduling conflicts.
Data-Driven Insights: Utilizes historical data to identify popular electives, emerging trends, and potential areas of interest.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive web interface for students to explore electives, view recommendations, and submit preferences.
How it Works

Data Collection: Gathers relevant data on students' academic records, course catalogs, and historical enrollment patterns.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares data for analysis, handling missing values and inconsistencies.
Feature Engineering: Extracts meaningful features from the data, such as student GPA, major, and past elective choices.
Model Training: Trains a machine learning model, such as a recommendation system or a classification model, to predict optimal elective choices.
Recommendation Generation: Utilizes the trained model to generate personalized elective recommendations for each student.
User Interface: Provides a web-based interface for students to view recommendations, explore elective details, and submit preferences.
Technical Implementation

The codebase includes:

Data Exploration and Visualization:
Imports necessary libraries (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Loads the dataset ("Book_1.csv")
Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations like histograms and bar plots to understand data distribution and trends.
Data Preprocessing:
Cleans and preprocesses the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
Selects relevant features for model training.
Model Training:
Content-Based Filtering:
Cosine Similarity: Measures the similarity between courses based on their features (e.g., course code, marks, grade, grade points). Courses with high cosine similarity are recommended.
Trains a model to learn the relationships between courses and their features.
Collaborative Filtering:
Analyzes student-course interaction data to find similar students and recommend courses they have liked.
User Interface:
Develops a user-friendly web interface to display recommendations, course details, and allow user interaction.
Future Enhancements

Incorporate Additional Data Sources: Consider incorporating student preferences, course descriptions, and faculty expertise to improve recommendation accuracy.
Explore Advanced Recommendation Techniques: Investigate hybrid recommendation systems or deep learning-based approaches for more sophisticated recommendations.
Enhance User Interface: Improve the user interface to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for students.
By leveraging this system, students can make informed decisions about their electives, enhancing their academic experience and future career prospects.
